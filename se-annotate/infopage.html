<center><h3>The StackExchange Annotation Project of the University of Melbourne</h3></center>
<p>The Annotation Project is carried out by the University of Melbourne, in collaboration with StackExchange.
More information on the researchers can be found here: <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/dorishoogeveen" target="_blank">Doris Hoogeveen</a>, <a href="http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff.php?person_ID=458973" target="_blank">Karin Verspoor</a> and <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/" target="_blank">Tim Baldwin</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to improve the StackExchange data, by finding duplicate questions and labelling them. We'd like to identify as many currently unlabelled duplicate question pairs as possible, with as little annotation as possible.</p>
<p>The project is part of Doris Hoogeveen's PhD research and is therefore not a commercial project. Any findings will be published and will be publicly available.</p>
<p>This page is intended to answer any questions you may have regarding the project, but if you feel that anything is missing, please don't hesitate to get in touch via the email link at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h4>What revision of the questions is being shown?</h4>
<p>StackExchange releases a periodic anonymised dump of all their user generated data (<a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange" target="_blank">https://archive.org/details/stackexchange</a>). The version we have used is dated xx-xx-xxxx. Of course, some duplicate labels may have been applied after this date. Unfortunately we have no way of using these. We will inevitably use a version of the data that is slightly behind the data on the website. This means that it might happen that you get presented two questions which have a duplicate label on the forum already. The idea is that we identify more than enough new pairs to make this potential slight duplicated effort worthwile.</p>
<h4>How many questions am I expected to review?</h4>
<p>That is completely up to you. When you log in, you will see a counter close to the top, indicating how many questions you've annotated and how many there are still left. You can stop whenever you want.</p>
<h4>Why are StackExchange URLs in the questions anonymised?</h4>
<p>If you want to know whether two questions already have a duplicate label on the forum, you can of course copy the title into Google, to find the question on the forums. Ideally though, we'd like you to make your judgement based on the text presented only. A link to a StackExchange URL may give you a clue about how to judge a particular pair. It might introduce a bias, which we'd like to try to avoid.</p>
<h4>What happens to my private information?</h4>
<p>Absolutely nothing. All we have of you is what we can get via the StackExchange API. The only thing we store is your account id, so that StackExchange knows who's annotated what. When the project is finished we will give them all the annotations, with the associated account ids.</p>
<h4>Can I get a demo user to see how it all works?</h4>
<p>Yes, there's a demo account. Just click on the 'Login as Demo' button on the <a href="./index.html">login page</a>.
All the annotations for this user will be automatically removed when there are no more question pairs left to annotate.</p>
<h4>How are the questions I'm reviewing selected?</h4>
<p>Two strategies have been applied to identify pairs of questions with a relatively high probability of being duplicates. From these two sets, we randomly draw pairs to show to you.</p>
<!-- Should we say more? Or not, so they are not biased? Should we mention SIGIR? -->
